I like languages&mdash;both natural languages and programming languages. In my professional life, I aim to combine these passions to create ethical, useful, and intuitive software.

I earned my BA in linguistics from UC Santa Cruz, where I focused primarily on syntax and phonology. I also had the opportunity to work as a research assistant on [the SPOT project](https://spot.sites.ucsc.edu), which allowed me to hone my software development skills <!--more-->and even [publish my own research](https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/view-chapter/?id=41004). While I had dabbled in computer programming before joining SPOT, this was my first experience working on a development team and on a public facing product, and I learned so much about software design, documentation, and collaboration.

My first job in the technology sector was as an Engineering Linguist at LinkedIn (contracted via WorkforceLogiq). There, I helped improve the job search and job recommendation features by labeling the quality of search results and recommendations and writing/maintaining the labeling guidelines. I also helped onboard new team members, presented our team's work to internal stakeholders, and bootstrapped analytics tools for understanding the results of our labeling projects.

Following the end of my contract with LinkedIn, I worked at Google (contracted via Intellipro Group) on various artificial intelligence and machine learning projects, including [PaLM 2](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-palm-2-ai-large-language-model/) (the large language model behind Bard), [Gmail Help Me Write](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/gmail-help-me-write-announced-at-google-io-2023-and-it-writes-entire-emails-for-you), and an [Area120](https://area120.google.com/) internal startup.

Now that my contract with Google has expired, I am looking for the next opportunity to help technology teams leverage the power of natural language.
