While completing my B.A. in Linguistics at UC Santa Cruz, I worked as a research assistant on the SPOT project, where I helped develop software and published a research paper. You can learn more about the project on the [SPOT website](https://spot.sites.ucsc.edu/) or explore the codebase on [GitHub](https://github.com/syntax-prosody-ot/main). SPOT also [published a book](https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/syntax-prosody/), which I contributed to. Feel free to [email me](mailto:bots@tarlov.dev) to request a pre-publication version of my chapter.
