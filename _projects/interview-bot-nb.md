Interviewing for jobs is tedious; in this notebook, I'll show you how to automate the process instead. I highly recomend that you open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/maxTarlov/6c8318ef10059d4ac5830cf34161e72e/interview-bot-part-one.ipynb) so that you can run the notebook and interact with the bot in a free virtual machine. It is also available as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/maxTarlov/6c8318ef10059d4ac5830cf34161e72e), which you can download and run locally. (You will have to install some dependencies on your own.)
